* _Filling google forms to sell/purchase study materials and equipments_
* _Scrolling through 100+ pdf of syllabus for a particular subject_

### Why should we solve it?
* _As a member of the college technical team, it's our responsibility to advance our college in terms of technology_  
* _As we are in a technical college, our daily life must be systematic not like a naive user_
* _These problems are supposed to be solved now or later_
* _This is going to be a live project which is used by many_
* _Awesome project to boost your resume_

### How do you propose to solve it?
* _Our first step is to develop a mobile app which contains appropriate solutions for these problems_

* _Its contain a feed section for latest opportunities, upcoming contest and tech news_
